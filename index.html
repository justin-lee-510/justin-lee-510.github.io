  <p style= "font-family: verdana; font-size: 15px;"> Grookey is a Grass type Pokémon introduced in Generation 8. It is known as the Chimp Pokémon.

Grookey is one of the starter Pokémon available in Pokémon Sword & Shield (releasing late 2019) along with Scorbunny and Sobble.

It is a mischievous Pokémon that is full of boundless curiosity. During the Sword & Shield announcement trailer it is seen tapping the stick it keeps in its hair, then climbing to the top of a building.

Grookey appears to be based on a spider monkey. </p>
