      <p style= "font-size:17px">I started really enjoying movies when I first saw a movie review from Chris Stuckmann. His passion and great analysis of films sparked
        an interest in me. I realized that great films, at their core, ask questions about the human condition. From there, I started to view movies differently and really
        appreciate the art. Here are some of my favorite movies!</p>

        </div>
        <p> A film centered on the simple joys of life, <strong> Little Forest </strong> is about the importance of food, friendship, and family. After Hye-won fails her teaching exam, she decides to return to the countryside, where she was raised.
         The scenery shown and the preparation of Korean cuisine are eye candy that pop with color and vibrancy.
         This is a movie about character growth that leaves you with a sense of warmth and euphoria. You can watch it for free on Amazon Prime! </p>

          <p> The film most known for winning Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars, Bong Joon Ho's newest entry is about a social satire depicting two families, the poverty stricken Kims and the

            </div>
            <p> <strong>Searching</strong> tells a story about a father trying to find his missing daughter. What makes this film so unique is its presentation. The entire film is
            filmed through a laptop screen, and director Aneesh Chaganty is able to convey emotion through text messages and other subtle actions. In a style very similar to that of <em>Up's</em> opening,
            Searching's opening scene introduces us to the Kim family. In just a few minutes, we learn about all three family members, and its presentation immediately attachs us to these characters. In an age where we're all
            connected through media, Searching shows the disconnect between father and daughter. </p>

            <p> <strong>The Farewell</strong> is a unique film based on a true events. The movie follows a Chinese American family who has learned that their grandmother will soon die of cancer.
              Upon the news, the whole family decides to keep this a secret from the grandma. This common Chinese practice is extremely hard for Billy, played by Awkwafina, who was raised in the States.
              "Chinese people have saying, when you get cancer, you die. But it's not the cancer that kills you, it's the fear." A dramatic tale about family and love, The Farewell will capture your heart. </p>

              <p> Whereas Toy Story 3 offered a satisfying conclusion to the Andy storyline, <strong>Toy Story 4</strong> provides closure for Woody's. Out of all the Toy Story entries, this is the most unique.
             After Bonnie makes Sporky at her first day of kindergarden, Woody dedicates himself to care for this new toy. With the help of Bo Pep, Woody finds a new purpose for himself. The animation level
           is stellar, and the new toys are extremely likeable.  </p>

                  </div>
                  <p> <strong>The Imitation Game</strong> takes place during World War II and is based on Alan Turing's momumental role in winning the war. Alan Turing is an English mathematician who is trying to decrypt
                    the German code from Enigma. Turing, who is an extremely momumental figure in mathematics and technological growth, is fighting more than one battle. He's gay, which was
                    extremely illegal at the time. So while Turing is battling against the decryption of the Enigma, he must also hide his sexuality. Filled with great performances and an enthrilling story, The Imitation Game
                 is a fantastic film about an unconventional hero. </p>

                    <p> <strong>The Social Network</strong>, a film about the creation of FaceBook, is a collaboration between director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. The witty conversations and characters present keep the audience
                      engaged. In a film consisting of all dialouge, Sorkin and Fincher are, somehow, able to keep the film at a fast pace. The Social Network depicts how the pursuit towards greatness can
                      result in a loss of humanity. Through Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to stand out, we witness his loss of apathy and the falling out with his best friend. This film holds a special place in my heart, since
                      it was one of the first works that sparked my passion for movies.  </p>

                    <p> My first Netflix original, <strong>Stranger Things</strong> offered an intriguing plot about a group of kids who try to find their friend. Season 1 is, in my opinion,
                      perfect. The creators were able to perfectly balance the roles of each characters and draw their arcs in an unexpected way. Seasons 2 & 3 are also great, and the production
                      is astounding by season 3. A great watch and a good time. </p>

                  <p> <strong>Green Book</strong> stars Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, and is about an unlikely duo. Set in 1962, the film tells a true story about jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American Tony
                    Vallelonga. Although the topic of segregation in the U.S. is heavy and depressing, the film is able to take a more light-hearted approach. The performances by both leads are
                    amazing and the story telling is spectacular. (Also, a story with piano performance is always a plus for me.)

                      <p> Warning! Do not watch Chef on an empty stomach. You will be miserable. All jokes aside, <strong>Chef </strong>is a fantastic film about father and son. When Chef Carl Casper

                      <p> <strong> Knives Out </strong>is the newest film written and directed by Rian Johnson. Johnson shows his incredible imagination and writing abilities with this creative
                        murder mystery. By altering the traditional structure of a who-done-it, Johnson is able to keep the audience surprised with his thrilling plot. The cast is also great,

                        <p> <strong> Mission: Impossible- Fallout </strong> is here to make all other action movies look like baby movies. This is the greatest action movie of the past decade. Tom Cruise
                          gives it his all in the stuntwork, with gripping and bare-knuckled fight scenes and chase sequences. I remember saying "oh my god" out loud in the theatres at a particular
                          running stunt, which actually injured Tom Cruise. This film is the perfect example of how exciting it is to see Cruise perform on screen. </p>

                  one weak link of an episode! The characters are entertaining and the plot is intriguing. One thing that this show does that most TV shows fail to bring, is that the characters are
                  constantly developing . Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, two of the main characters, go through deep change with each plot point. I love this show, end of story. </p>

                  <p> The second entry in the Star Wars sequel, <strong>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</strong> challenged the viewer on their conception of a Star Wars movie. Perhaps the
                    most polarizing film, the story split fans and critics. With an audience score of 43% and a critic score of 90% on Rottom Tomatoes, this is definitely a film that sparks discourse. However,
                    I enjoy this story for taking risks, developing our characters in an unconventional way, and providing amazing spectacle for the eye. </p>

                    <p> <strong>Ip Man</strong> is a martial arts film based on the real life events of 葉問(Ip Man). During the Japanese invasion of World War 2, Ip Man struggles to
                      provide for his family. A Japanese general establishes a dojo where Chinese martial artists can compete with his officials, and Ip Man gets entangled in their affairs.
                     With fight sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat, Ip Man is one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made. </p>
