      <p style= "font-size:17px">I started enjoying movies when I first saw a movie review from Chris Stuckmann. His passion and great analysis of films sparked
        a fascination within me. I realized that great films, at their core, ask questions about the human condition. I started to view movies differently and really
        appreciate the art. I have linked the trailer to each film as well. You can hover on each movie poster and click its rating to watch it. Here are some of my favorite movies!</p>

        </div>
        <p> A film centered on the simple joys of life, <strong> Little Forest </strong> is about the importance of food, friendship, and family. After Hye-won fails her teaching exam, she decides to return to the countryside, where she was raised.
         The scenery shown and the preparation of Korean cuisine are eye candy that pop with color and vibrancy.
         This is a movie about character growth that leaves you with a sense of warmth and euphoria. You can watch it for free on Amazon Prime! </p>

          </div>
          <p> The film best known for winning the Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars, Bong Joon Ho's newest entry explores the social differences of two families, the poverty stricken Kims and the
            wealthy Parks. <strong>Parasite</strong> has amazing writing, comedy, and an inspiration cooking scene that taught me how to cook jjapaguri noodles.  </p>

            </div>
            <p> <strong>Searching</strong> tells a story about a father trying to find his missing daughter. What makes this film so unique is its presentation. The entire film is
            filmed through a laptop screen, and director Aneesh Chaganty conveys emotion through text messages and subtle actions. In a style very similar to that of <em>Up's</em> opening,
            Searching's opening scene introduces us to the Kim family. In just a few minutes, we learn about all three family members, and its presentation immediately attachs us to these characters. In an age where we're all
            connected through media, Searching explores the disconnect between father and daughter. </p>

              </div>
              <p> <strong>Edge of Tomorrow</strong> stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, and is an adaption of the Japanese manga "All You Need is Kill". The film is set during a world war against an alien race who possess the
                ability to control time.  When Tom Cruise's character, William Cage, inherates this power, he must join forces with soldier Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to find a way to destroy the enemy.
              This movie is very unique in its concept and presentation. Edge of Tomorrow is a great summer blockbuster that will keep your eyes glued
              to the screen. </p>

            </div>
            <p> <strong>The Farewell</strong> is a intriguing drama based on a true event. The movie follows a Chinese American family who has learned that their grandmother will soon die of cancer.
              Upon hearing the news, the family decides not to tell the grandma. This common Chinese practice is extremely hard for Billy, who was raised in the States.

              <p> Whereas Toy Story 3 offered a satisfying conclusion to the Andy storyline, <strong>Toy Story 4</strong> provides closure for Woody's.
             After Bonnie makes Sporky at her first day of kindergarden, Woody dedicates himself to care for this new toy. With the help of Bo Pep, Woody finds new purpose within himself. The animation

                <p> Finally, a truly great Korean Drama! <strong>My Mister</strong> is a 16 episode drama about three bothers and a young women who are enduring the hardships of life.
                They learn to heal from one another in this story that can only be described as cathartic. The first few episodes are bit slow, but the themes present are extremely
              powerful. My Mister also features amazing performances from the whole cast, including IU.  </p>

                Avengers: Infinity War, our heros must come to terms with reality, and when a chance to bring back their loved ones is presented, they embark on a journey to fight once more.

                  </div>
                  <p> <strong>The Imitation Game</strong> is based on a true story of mathematician Alan Turing and his momumental contribution during World War II. Turing is an English mathematician who is trying to decrypt
                    the German code. Turing, who is an extremely important figure in mathematics and technological growth, is fighting more than one battle. He's gay, which was
                    extremely illegal at the time. So while Turing is battling against the decryption of the Enigma, he must also hide his sexuality. Filled with great performances and an enthrilling story, The Imitation Game
                 is a fantastic film about an unconventional hero. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p> <strong>The Social Network</strong>, a film about the creation of FaceBook, is a collaboration between director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. The witty conversations and characters present keep the audience
                      engaged. In a film consisting of all dialouge, Sorkin and Fincher are, somehow, able to keep the film engaging. The Social Network depicts how the pursuit towards greatness can
                      result in a loss of humanity. Through Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to stand out, we witness his loss of apathy and the falling out with his best friend. This film holds a special place in my heart, since
                      it was one of the first films that sparked my passion for movies.  </p>

                      </div>
                    <p> The X-Men franchise has had a monumental influence on super hero films. Back in 2000, most comic book movies were not taken seriously.
                   The X-Men movies, while featuring super heroes and fun action, are actually about discrimination and tolerance. Humans are at war with the mutants, and
                   Wolverine must go back in time to save the future. <strong>Days of Future Past</strong> is one of my favorite super hero movies because of its great story, mature themes,
                 and fun characters. </p>

                    <p> My first Netflix original, <strong>Stranger Things</strong> offered an intriguing plot about a group of kids who try to find their friend. Season 1 is, in my opinion,
                      perfect. The creators were able to perfectly balance the roles of each characters and draw their arcs in an unexpected way. Seasons 2 & 3 are also great, and the production
                      is astounding by season 3. This show alone is worth a subscription. </p>

                  <p> <strong>Green Book</strong> stars Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, and tells the true story of an unlikely friendship during a time of discrimination. Set in 1962, the film follows jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American Tony
                    Vallelonga as they traverse the deep South. Although the topic of segregation in the U.S. is heavy and depressing, the film is able to take a more light-hearted approach. The performances by both leads are
                    amazing and the story telling is spectacular. (Also, a story with piano performance is always a plus for me.)

                        <p> This was the film that got me really interested in the Star Trek franchise. Since the main TV shows were before my time, I never had a real exposure to this world. This movie,
                          however, introduced me to this universe. I really love <strong>Star Trek - Into Darkness</strong>! I still remember watching this sequel in theatres with enjoyment. The cast is great, the visual effects
                          are top notch, and the story is very compelling. This is my favorite entry in the sleek-looking 'Kelvin' trilogy, and although it is a divisive film amongst Star Trek fans, I can't help but have fun rewatching it.
                          I think this film will appeal to anyone, Trek fan or otherwise. </p>

                        <p> <strong> Mission: Impossible- Fallout </strong> is here to make all other action movies look like baby movies. This is quite possibly the greatest action movie of the past decade. Tom Cruise
                          gives it his all, with gripping and bare-knuckled fight scenes and chase sequences. The plot is also thrilling and requires you to really pay attention.
                           This film is the perfect example of how exciting it is to see Cruise perform on screen. </p>

                <p> After watching Stranger Things during quarantine season, I was ready to hop onto another TV show that would entertain me for a good month or so. However, it was tricky
                  to find a show that would keep me consistantly hooked the way Stranger Things did... until <strong> Breaking Bad </strong>. This show is a masterpiece from start to finish. There is not
                  one weak link of an episode! The characters are entertaining and the plot is intriguing. One thing that this show does that most TV shows fail to bring, is that the characters are
                  constantly developing. Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, two of the main characters, go through deep change with each plot point. Breaking Bad is an instant classic. </p>

              <p> <strong>Zootopia</strong> is an animated Disney movie about a rabbit who aspires to become a successful cop. Due to social prejudice, however, she finds that her job is harder than expected. This film
                is a fantastic family movie with a deep and mature message about discrimination. A movie that is so applicable in today's world, Zootopia is able to succeed in both its social
                commentary and its story telling. </p>

                  <p> After Avengers: Age of Ultron, the governments of the world decide to dictate and control the Avengers. When Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark disagree on if the facility should be
                    governed, a civil war brews. <strong>Captain America - Civil War</strong> focuses on the clash between two characters who have gone through great arcs to define their character. Because of the events of
                    Captain America - The Winter Soldier, Steve no longer trusts governments of power. He feels they can become easily corrupt, and that the safest hands are his own. However, Tony has lived through many
                    mistakes, and with this guilt, he tries to controls the Avengers in an attempt to do the right thing. A great film that defines what the Marvel Cinematic Universe is all about: characters. </p>

                  <p> <strong>The Peanuts Movie</strong> is an animated film about Charlie Brown and his struggles to be exceptional. This is a fantastic movie for both kids and adults with a great message for
                    younger audiences. Nothing here is overly "modernized" and the film does not stray away from the source material. The animation is stellar and the movie honors Charles Schulz's legacy. </p>

                  <p> The second entry in the Star Wars sequel, <strong>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</strong> challenged the viewer on their conception of a Star Wars movie. Perhaps the
                    most polarizing film, the story split fans and critics. With an audience score of 43% and a critic score of 90% on Rottom Tomatoes, this is definitely a film that sparks discourse. However,
                    I enjoy this story for changing the Star Wars "formula", developing our characters in an unconventional way, and providing amazing spectacle for the eye. </p>

                      provide for his family. A Japanese general establishes a dojo where Chinese martial artists can compete with his officials, and Ip Man gets entangled in their affairs.
                     With fight sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat, Ip Man is one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made. </p>

                  <p> The final entry that concludes the Apes trilogy, <strong>War for the Planet of the Apes</strong> is a stunning masterpiece. It's hard to imagine the work that went into
                    crafting this tale. From the great performances, flawless visual effects, and emotional story, War nails every aspect of telling a compelling story. This is one of the best trilogies, and
                    although I never saw the original Planet of the Apes media, I was quite invested in the whole story.  </p>
