        repetoire, technique, music theory, ear training, stage presence, and more. These many aspects of music help my students become well-rounded musicians. <br>
        Below is a short description of each student with a video of their favorite performance! These star students all work very hard and practice many times a week.</p>

  <p> <strong> Meet Kenneth! </strong> Kenneth is the newest student in the studio. He started piano this March, and although he hasn't had an in-person
              lesson with me yet, he is playing through his pieces with flying colors! Thanks to his hard work and supportive parents, Kenneth is already growing to be a strong musician. He will be entering
            kindergarten, although he sounds like a mature third grader! Besides piano, Kenneth enjoys spending time with his sister Cheryl, playing with cars, and building Legos.
