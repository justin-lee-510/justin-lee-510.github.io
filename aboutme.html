<h2 style= "color:skyblue"> Purpose </h2>
<p> This is a learning experience for me! After learning Java and Python at the basic levels,
  I found that I really enjoy programming, at least at the basic level. HTML is a bit different, however,
  since it isn't coding more so than just learning syntax working with files. However, I want this to
  eventually become a website that I can use to promote my piano studio. For now, I guess, this will be a website about
  Grookey the monkey. </p>

<h2 style="color:skyblue"> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Justin, and I am currently a Senior at the University of Redlands.
  I am studying piano and mathematics as a double degree. Juggling both subjects has been quite interesting,
  but definitely possible. During the summer, I teach piano and try to learn different programming techniques.
  I also enjoy watching movies and playing video games, which, I know, are not the most unique hobbies to have. </p>
