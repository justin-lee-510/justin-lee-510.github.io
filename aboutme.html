<a href= "./index.html"> Home </a>

<p> This is a learning experience for me! After learning Java and Python at the basic levels,
  I found that I really enjoy programming, at least at the basic level. HTML is a bit different, however,
  since it isn't coding more so than just learning syntax working with files. However, I want this to
  eventually become a website that I can use to promote my piano studio. For now, I guess, this will be a website about
  Grookey the monkey. </p>
